10,Homemade Cranberry Juice,CharlotteJ,8M,1M,9M,2006-05-11,"I'm a cranberry nut. I just can't get enough of these berries.  Here are some fun facts I found on the web.    Cranberries are one of the only three native North American Fruits (Concord grapes, and blueberries being the others). To the eastern Indians, cranberries were known as sassamanesh. The Cape Cod Pequots and the South Jersey Leni- Lenape tribes called the little red berry ibimi or bitter berry. But it was the Pilgrims who gave the cranberry its modern name. To them, the pink cranberry blossoms resembled the heads of cranes; therefore the word crane berry later contracted to cranberry. Early American sailors carried barrels of cranberries while at sea as a source of vitamin C, much like the British limeys carried limes aboard ships.","{""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/16/78/17/picyzloU8.jpg""}","{""1"", ""1"", NA}","{""fresh cranberries"", ""frozen cranberries"", ""water"", ""sugar""}",5,17,0,"{""Wash and drain fresh or frozen red-ripe cranberries."", ""Combine cranberries and water in a large pan."", ""Bring to a boil."", ""Reduce heat and cook until berries burst."", ""Strain juice through a fine strainer lined with cheese cloth."", ""Sugar can be added to juice to your taste."", ""Reheat juice until it is almost, but not boiling."", ""Pour into jars."", ""Allow to cool before refrigerating.""}"

392,Oatmeal Butterscotch Toffee-Crisp Cookies,MrsGoodall,NA,30M,30M,2006-05-16,"These cookies are to die for!!  I promise and so do all my friends, family and co-workers.  I was looking for a thin crispy oatmeal cookie.  I found a number of nice recipes and took ideas from many of them.  On the third attempt, this is the recipe I came up with.  Special notes, you MUST use parchment paper to bake the cookies on.  If you don't they will stick to the pan and break (even if you grease the pan).  The batter gets thicker as you add ingredients.  I add the rice cereal last, so that they are crushed as little as possible.  I have tried using more and less flour.  Less flour and the cookies don't form.  More flour and they don't get crispy.  A special thanks to PanNan, who's Crispy Coconut-Oatmeal Cookies gave me the recipe's basic foundation.","{""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/16/82/14/picFbUH9n.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/16/82/14/picjqXQHT.jpg""}","{""1"", ""1"", ""1"", ""2"", ""1"", ""1/2"", ""1/4"", ""1 1/2"", ""1"", ""1"", ""2"", ""2/3"", ""1 1/2"", ""1 1/2""}","{""unsalted butter"", ""sugar"", ""light brown sugar"", ""eggs"", ""vanilla extract"", ""nutmeg"", ""flour"", ""baking soda"", ""salt"", ""rolled oats""}",5,8,0,"{""Beat butter and sugars at medium speed with an electric mixer until blended; add eggs, vanilla and almond extract, beating well."", ""In a separate bowl, combine flour, baking soda, salt and nutmeg; add to butter mixture, mixing well."", ""Stir in oats."", ""Stir in toffee bar pieces {don't use the \""toffee dust\"" that comes from crushing the bars, just the small pieces}."", ""Mix in butterscotch chips.

393,Easy Truffles,Jogreen,NA,15M,15M,2006-05-16,"These are really just too easy to make!!!! The beauty of these is that they can be made with whatever biscuit/cookie you prefer and coated with whatever you have in the pantry. You can also leave them uncoated if you wish. So far, here in NZ I have only made them with 'Toffee Pops' but I have made 2 batches.......one for my daughter's 2nd birthday as a treat for the attending adults and again for my nephews 2nd birthday lunch the next day. They were well received :)  I dipped mine to cover half way up the ball in melted dark chocolate but you can use white or milk chocolate, or, roll the balls in chopped nuts, cocoa, coconut, candy sprinkles or even a combination.....the choice is yours. Yield is dependent on size.  EDITED TO ADD (For those in NZ or Australia).....Since making these a few times I have found that by using 2 pkts Toffee Pops plus 1 pkt of Griffins Peach or Mint Sensation biscuits it gives an even better result. Also if you are not so fond of a cream cheese taste use 3pkts biscuits of your choice.  They can also be frozen or will keep for up to a week in the fridge.

While that&rsquo;s a time-honored tradition, the trend now is to healthier and veggie-based soups. This idea helps you to convince your &ldquo;bread, meat and potatoes&rdquo; DH and your &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like veggies&rdquo; kids that eating healthier can be tasty and fun.

Add 12 oz of beer {I prefer to use the pale beers and drink the dark. It will alter the flavor the darker the more bitter. It's about you not the guest--it's your food your creation}. Mix well till smooth. Add the baking powder and the Cajun season or make your own. I go with mostly paprika, a dash of garlic and onion powder, and a pinch cayenne and red pepper, but only make a tablespoons worth. Mix evenly then add the flour little at a time. This prevents clumping--no one wants to eat a flour ball.  You should have a rich and smooth texture.  To test this, dip a spoon in and pull it out.  The spoon should stay covered. If it is runny, add a little flour till you have the consistency you want. Place in the fridge and let chill. {Shelf life 1.5 days}."",

To peel shrimp, leave the tale on and try not to bend the shrimp too hard.  You don't want to break its back yet. Be sure to remove the spinal column {known as the vein}.

Mix the seasoning well in to the flour. It will have an orange tint. Take the shrimp and snap it a little in the middle of the back {you will feel it, trust me} then cover it in the flour, then dip in the beer batter, and then roll it in the coconut. This will get messy. Repeat with all shrimp and place in basket. When you put the basket in the fryer they will float.  You might want to hold them down with a metal spatula. They should cook for 2-2 1/2 minutes or until golden brown. It is important that you let them cook this long. You do not want raw shrimp. If your shrimp are too big, you will cook longer--too small, cook less. Use good judgment here! They should come out flat on the bottom.  Now you can snap the middle piece of the tail inwards so they fan out."",
